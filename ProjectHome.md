# jGoogleSafeBrowsing is currently being upgraded to support v2 of the API #

This project has been quiet for a while, apologies about that. I am re-developing a good chunk of it to support the V2 of the API, and cleaning up some of the problems and quirks reported. This will also be a Maven 2 project moving forward .


jGoogleSafeBrowsing is a Java Library for Accessing the experimental Google Safe Browsing API.

You can find out more at http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/

The library can be used with flat files or via JDBC, you have both options.
